# Learning Log
​
## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
<!-- Design tokens, state vs appearance, system preference, persistence -->
I learned about design tokensns, state vs. appearance and system preferences.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
I'm still uncomfortable with JavaScript so adding in the local storage element and adding "memory" to my site was a little tricky at first. It also took my a minute to understand the difference between state vs. appearance as well. ​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
I asked ChatGPT about localStorage and why it matters because I wasn't really understanding the significance of it.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
Local storage is still a little fuzzy.
