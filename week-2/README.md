# Week 2: The Memory
​
### What I Learned
I learned a lot about variables this week and how to use Figma's variable feature. I also learned 
​
### What Was Hard
I don't have the clearest idea of how I am going to translate my Figma variables into code properly, but I think it will make more sense to me this week.
​
### How I Used AI
I used Chat to help me with the Codedex conditionals. It helped get me on the right track so I could start writing the code myself.
​
### What's Still Unclear
I need more practice with conditionals. Especially the random.math() function.
