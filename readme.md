## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
I think I gained a pretty solid understanding of using the console. The console exploration exercises/the Codedex stuff was pretty helpful and I was able to get through it smoothly without struggling a lot.
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
I was a little frustrated when setting up my behavioral layer. I took so long getting my Java Script set up properly in codespace that I got burnt quickly and I am struggling to find the motivation to finish it. I'm not sure why it was so difficult for me, I think I was just exhausted from the first week of school. I think it will get a lot easier and quicker for me as I continue to practice. ​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
Yes! I used ChatGPT to debug when working on my Behavioral Layer set up. It helped a lot! I had a few tiny errors (extra spaces and apostrophes) that I would have never caught on my own. That definitely saved my sanity!​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I think I just need to set a aside a few hours to struggle through the rest of my behavioral layer set up assignment. I also definitely need to practice my Java Script skills and get a little more comfortable with setting it up.​
